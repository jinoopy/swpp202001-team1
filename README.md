## How to use

---

### Dev mode

`python3 compiler.py -dev`

Enters the dev mode, which we can load custom passes.

### Build mode

`python3 compiler.py -build (-bin (llvm/bin dir))`

Builds the cpp sources from /src.
`-bin` is set to what is in config.json for default.

### Run mode

<b> NOT_IMPLEMENTED </b>

`python3 compiler.py -run (input file .ll) (-bin (llvm/bin directory)) (-o (output file .s))`

Emits the result in .s format of our target machine.
`-bin` is set to what is in config.json for default.
`-o`, for default, is set to a file which has the same name with the input, but only the extension is different.
- `./test/input.ll` â†’ `./test/input.s`


## About config.json

---

You may change settings of config.json. This file will be hidden in further commits.

#

`"llvm-bin-dir": "...."`

Value of this field should be the llvm bin directory, i.e. `llvmscript/llvm-10.0-release/bin.`
This field can be updated manually, or in the `-dev` mode, or with giving the right argument to `-build` or `-run` mode.

#

`"opt-pass": ....`

This field is recommended to fix with `-dev` mode. Do not touch if necessary.

#

`"preset-passes": ....`

You may freely touch the list of presets included.
If you add a custom pipeline, this will appear in the 3rd option in the `-dev` mode.

#

`"run": ...`

This is for the run mode later on. Do not touch or modify now.
